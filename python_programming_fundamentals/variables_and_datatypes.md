## Variables

### Definition
Variables are containers that are used to store the values.

### Naming convention of variables
- Name should start with letter or underscore.
- should not start with number.
- should not contain special characters.
#### 
Note: Variables are case sensitive.

### Declaring Variables
variable_name = "value"
example: a = 10
         name = "Mili"
         
### Scope of Variables
The part of program where a variable is accessible is called its scope. 
In other words, it is the visible of variable declared within a specific code block.
- There are 2 types of scopes
1. local (variable declared within a function)
2. global (variable declared in the main body of the program. We use `global` keyword to declare the global variable)
         
## Datatypes

- Text Type:	str
- Numeric Types:	int, float, complex

## How to know the type of data.
we can find the type of data using `type` inbuilt method.

## Typecasting
Converting one data type to another datatype is called typecasting.
