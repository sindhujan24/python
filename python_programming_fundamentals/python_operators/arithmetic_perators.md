# Arithematic Operators
Arithematic Operators are used for performing basic arithematic operations in Python.

## 1. Addition Operator
Addition operator adds two values.
### x+y
x=10
y=20
x+y
30

## 2. Subtraction Operator
Subtraction operator subtracts one value from the other.
### x-y
x=20
y=10
x-y
10

## 3. Multiplication Operator
Multiplication operator multiplies two values.
### x*y
x,y=10,10
10*10
100

## 4. Dividend Operator
Dividend operator divides one operand by another.
### x/y
numerator,denominator=10,5
numerator/denominator
2.0


## 5. Modulus Operator
Modulus operator returns remainder of the division
### x%y
x,y=5,2
X%2
1

## 6. Exponent Operator
Exponent Operator raises the power of left operand to the right operand.
### x**y
x,y=2,3
x**y
8

## 7. Floor Division Operator
Floor division operator returns quotient rounded off to the nearest integer.
### x//y

764//56

8746//14

# Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign a value to the variable.

## 1. Equals to (=) Operator
Equals to (=) operator assigne the value of right hand operand to the left hand operand.

x = 7
y = 3.65

## 2. Add Equal to (+=) Operator
Add equal to (+=) Operator adds right hand operand to the left hand operand and assign the result to the left hand operand.
###  x+=y       x=x+y 

x = 7
y = 4
x+=y
x

## 3. Subtract Equal to (-=) Operator
Subtract equal to (-=) operator subtracts right hand operand from the left hand operand and assign the result to the left hand operand.
### x-=y  x=x-y

x = 45
y = 12
x-=y
x

## 4. Mutliply Equal to (*=) Operator
Multiply equal to (*=) operator multiplies right hand operand by left hand operand and assign the result to the left hand operand.
### x*=y x=x*y

x = 23
y = 4
x*=y
x

## 5. Divide Equal to (/=) Operator
Divide equal to (/=) operator divides left operand by right operand and assign the result to left hand operand.
### x/=y    x=x/y

x = 35
y = 5
x/=y
x

## 6. Modulus Equal to (%=) Operator
Modulus equal to (%=) operator takes the module of the left operand and, using the right operand, stores the result in the left operand.
### x%=y    x=x%y

x = 456
y = 23
x%=y
x

## 7. Exponent Equal to (**=) Operator
Exponent equal to (****=) operator raises the exponential power of the left operand to the value of the right operand, storing the result in the left operand.
### x**=y   x=x**y


x = 7
y = 4
x**=y
x

## 8. Floor Equal to (//=) Operator
Floor equal to (//=) operator  divides the value found in the left operand by the value of the right operand. The integer result will be placed in the left operand.
### x//=y    x=x//y

x = 764
y = 56
x//=y
x

# Ninja Trick!!!


x = 10
x+5
x

x = 10
x+=5
x
