# Identity Operator
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

## 1. "is" Operator
“is” operator which evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and false otherwise.

x = 10
y = 10
x is y

z = 20
x is z

## 2. "is not" Operator
“is not” operator which evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and true otherwise.

x = 10
y = 20
x is not y

z = 20
y is not z

# Membership Operator
Membership operators are operators used to validate the membership of a value.

## 1. "in" Operator
“in” operator evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.

t = (3,6,4,1)
3 in t

## 2. "not in" Operator
“not in” operator which Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.

t = (6,3,9,0,5)
5 not in t
